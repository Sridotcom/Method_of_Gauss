# Method_of_Gauss
Hello! I wrote this code during my time at the Summer Science Program in Astrophysics at New Mexico State University.
This code takes in an input of 3 observations of an asteroid and the position of the asteroids at these times. Utilizing the Method of Gauss (outlined in the Copy of Orbit Report file) the program will calculate the orbital parameters of the asteroid (ie how the orbit is shaped).
