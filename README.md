# Method_of_Gauss
Hello! I wrote this code during my time at the Summer Science Program in Astrophysics at New Mexico State University.
This code takes in an input of 3 observations of an asteroid and the position of the asteroids at these times. Utilizing the Method of Gauss (outlined in copy_of_orbit_report) the program will calculate the orbital parameters of the asteroid (ie how the orbit is shaped).
